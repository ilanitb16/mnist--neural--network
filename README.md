This repository contains the solution for **Exercise 4** of the Machine Learning course. It is divided into two main parts:
1. **Part 1: Neural Network using NumPy** (37 points)  
2. **Part 2: Neural Network in PyTorch** (63 points)

The goal is to implement and analyze neural network models first from scratch in NumPy, then using PyTorch.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive Data Analysis: Detailed exploration and manipulation of datasets to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.
- Predictive Modeling: Introduction to building and refining predictive models using advanced statistical methods.
- Interactive Visualizations: Leveraging Python's visualization libraries to create interactive plots that effectively communicate the results of data analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Techniques for handling missing data, anomalies, and extracting relevant features for analysis.
